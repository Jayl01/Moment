Theme: Momentary

Idea: A game where you fight multiple randomly spawning enemies in a randomly generated side-scroller map.
Your goal is to go 2500 tiles to the right alive.
The incorporation of the theme is that when you're about to die, you have one or two seconds to press a specific directional key to dodge.
The intended purpose is to be a fast-paced game where your reaction Moments are tested both while in the field and near death.
